# UCSB Theta Tau Website V.2

## About the Website

We plan to rebuild the website using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack to improve the speed(load time)
and to redesign the website.

## New Features

The main new feature we are planning to add is to create a login system for current active and alumni members. Every
member would have their own personal page where they give some insight about their background and update their info
as they wish. Other possible new features:

1.  Page to email us directly about questions
2.  Sign up feature for latest updates/reminders about rush and events that are going on
3.  Family tree
