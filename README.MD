# UCSB Theta Tau Website V.2

 ## About the Website
 We plan to rebuild the website using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack to improve the speed(load time) 
and to redesign the website.

 ## New Features
The main new feature we are planning to add is to create a login system for current active and alumni members. Every
member would have their own personal page where they give some insight about their background and update their info 
as they wish. Other possible new features:
1. Page to email us directly about questions
2. Sign up feature for latest updates/reminders about rush and events that are going on
3. Family tree

## How it works.
This project is currently in the development phase.
### Running the project
#### Prerequisites
Please make your own database on mLab when working on this repo. Make sure you have dotenv install and .env added to your gitignore! Create a file in your root directory called .env and added two variables into the file called MONGO_DB and SECRET_OR_KEY and add the corresponding values into each variable.
#### Running
Running the project is simple. In the root directory, type in the command "npm run dev" and this command will run both the frontend and backend of the project.
